01: In sum...

    Write a function sum that takes a single argument n
    and computes the sum of all integers between 0 and n inclusive.
    Assume n is non-negative.

02: Misconceptions

    The following examples of recursive functions show some examples of common recursion mistakes.
    Fix them so that they work as intended.

03: Question 8: Hailstone

    For the hailstone function from homework 1, you pick a positive integer n as the start.
    If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
    Repeat this process until n is 1.
    Write a recursive version of hailstone that prints out the values of the sequence and returns the number of steps.
