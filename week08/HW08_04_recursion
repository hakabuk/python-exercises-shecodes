04: Paths

    Consider an insect in an M by N grid. The insect starts at the bottom left corner, (0, 0),
    and wants to end up at the top right corner, (M-1, N-1). The insect is only capable of moving right or up.
    Write a function paths that takes a grid length and width
    and returns the number of different paths the insect can take from the start to the goal.
    (There is a closed-form solution to this problem, but try to answer it procedurally using recursion.)

    For example, the 2 by 2 grid has a total of two ways for the insect to move from the start to the goal.
    For the 3 by 3 grid, the insect has 6 diferent paths (only 3 are shown above).

    M by N grid to the opposite corner.

    >>> paths(2, 2)
    2
    >>> paths(5, 7)
    210
    >>> paths(117, 1)
    1
    >>> paths(1, 157)
    1
