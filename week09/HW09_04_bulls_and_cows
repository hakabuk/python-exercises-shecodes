04: Alice and Bob are playing "Bulls and cows".
    Alice chooses a string of 5 letters. Bob needs to guess it in as few rounds as possible.
    On each round Bob guesses a string, and receives the next details:
    Bull: Guessed a letter in the right position
    Cow: Guessed a letter in the wrong position

    Write a function cows_and_bulls that receives the 2 strings - the real and the guess, and returns "Bull" and/or "Cow".
    You can count the number of cows as the devision of the matching letters and the number of Bulls.

    Write the game itself.
    Write a function that creates a random string and asks the user to enter his guess.
    The functions tells the user how many hits ans how many Bool he got.
    If the user got the answer - He wins. Otherwise - he gets to guess again.

    Add a correctness check: Since we're dealing with user input,
    what if instead of inserting a 5 char string he inputs a longer string?
    Or leaves it empty? Think of invalid inputs and deal with it.
    If you caught an invalid guess - ask the user for a new guess.
